# Network Basics

## What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a collection of computers and other devices connected together to share resources and communicate with each other. Networks can range from small connections between two computers to millions of devices worldwide.

## Network Types

### Based on Size

- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Very small network for personal devices (Bluetooth connections)
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Network within a limited area (home, office, building)
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Spans large geographical areas (like the Internet)
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN (city-wide)

### Based on Architecture

- **Client-Server**: Central servers provide resources to client computers
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Computers share resources directly without a central server

## Network Components

### Hardware

1. **Devices**
   - **End Devices**: Computers, smartphones, printers, servers
   - **Networking Devices**: Routers, switches, modems, access points

2. **Transmission Media**
   - **Wired**: Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables
   - **Wireless**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular

### Software

- **Operating Systems**: Network features built into Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Network Services**: DHCP, DNS, file sharing
- **Applications**: Web browsers, email clients, messaging apps

## Network Topologies

The physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network:

- **Bus**: All devices connected to a single backbone cable
- **Star**: All devices connected to a central hub or switch
- **Ring**: Devices connected in a closed loop
- **Mesh**: Every device connected directly to every other device
- **Tree/Hierarchical**: Combination of multiple star networks
- **Hybrid**: Combination of two or more topologies

## Basic Networking Concepts

### IP Addresses

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. There are two versions:

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address written as four numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address written as eight groups of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

### MAC Addresses

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). It's a hardware address consisting of six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

### Protocols

Protocols are sets of rules governing how data is transmitted across networks:

- **TCP/IP**: The fundamental suite of protocols for internet communications
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: For web browsing
- **FTP**: For file transfers
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP**: For email
- **SSH**: For secure remote access

### Ports

Ports are virtual endpoints for communication. They help direct traffic to the correct application on a device:

- **HTTP**: Port 80
- **HTTPS**: Port 443
- **FTP**: Port 21
- **SMTP**: Port 25
- **DNS**: Port 53

## Setting Up a Home Network

1. **Connect your modem** to the internet service provided by your ISP
2. **Connect a router** to your modem
3. **Configure your router** (set up Wi-Fi name and password)
4. **Connect devices** via Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi
5. **Test your connection**

## Troubleshooting Network Problems

Common solutions for network issues:

1. **Restart network equipment** (modem, router)
2. **Check physical connections**
3. **Verify network settings** (IP address, DNS)
4. **Test connectivity** (ping, traceroute)
5. **Update drivers and firmware**

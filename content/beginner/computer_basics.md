# Computer Basics

Understanding how computers work is essential for anyone entering the IT field. In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental components and processes that make computers function.

## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to a set of instructions called programs. All computers, regardless of their size or complexity, perform four basic functions:

1. **Input**: Receiving data and instructions
2. **Processing**: Manipulating data according to instructions
3. **Storage**: Saving data and instructions
4. **Output**: Presenting results to users

## Computer Hardware Components

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the "brain" of the computer that executes instructions:

- **Control Unit**: Directs the flow of data and instructions
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations
- **Registers**: Small, fast storage areas within the CPU
- **Cache**: High-speed memory for frequently accessed data

Popular CPU manufacturers include Intel, AMD, and ARM.

### Memory (RAM)

Random Access Memory (RAM) is temporary storage that the CPU uses while running programs:

- **Volatile**: Contents are lost when power is turned off
- **Fast access**: Much faster than storage devices
- **Capacity**: Measured in gigabytes (GB)
- **Types**: DDR4, DDR5 are current standards

### Storage Devices

Permanent storage for data and programs:

#### Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
- **Mechanical**: Use spinning platters and read/write heads
- **Capacity**: Large storage capacity (1TB-10TB+)
- **Speed**: Slower than SSDs but more affordable
- **Use case**: Bulk storage, backups

#### Solid State Drives (SSDs)
- **Electronic**: No moving parts, use flash memory
- **Speed**: Much faster than HDDs
- **Reliability**: More durable due to no mechanical parts
- **Cost**: More expensive per GB than HDDs

### Motherboard

The main circuit board that connects all components:

- **CPU socket**: Where the processor is installed
- **RAM slots**: For memory modules
- **Expansion slots**: For graphics cards, network cards, etc.
- **Connectors**: For storage devices, USB ports, audio
- **BIOS/UEFI**: Firmware that initializes the system

### Input Devices

Hardware for entering data and commands:

- **Keyboard**: Text input and commands
- **Mouse/Trackpad**: Pointing and clicking
- **Touchscreen**: Direct interaction with display
- **Microphone**: Audio input
- **Camera**: Video input
- **Scanner**: Converting physical documents to digital

### Output Devices

Hardware for presenting information to users:

- **Monitor/Display**: Visual output
- **Speakers/Headphones**: Audio output
- **Printer**: Physical document output
- **Projector**: Large-scale visual display

## How Computers Process Information

### Binary System

Computers use the binary number system (base-2):

- Only two digits: 0 and 1
- Each digit is called a "bit" (binary digit)
- 8 bits make a "byte"
- All data is represented as combinations of 0s and 1s

Example: The letter "A" in ASCII is represented as 01000001

### Data Representation

Different types of data are encoded in binary:

- **Text**: ASCII and Unicode character encoding
- **Numbers**: Binary representation of decimal values
- **Images**: Pixel color values
- **Audio**: Sound wave amplitude samples
- **Video**: Sequences of images with audio

### Processing Steps

1. **Fetch**: CPU retrieves instruction from memory
2. **Decode**: CPU interprets what the instruction means
3. **Execute**: CPU performs the required operation
4. **Store**: CPU saves the result back to memory

This cycle repeats billions of times per second!

## Computer Performance Factors

### CPU Speed
- **Clock Speed**: Measured in gigahertz (GHz)
- **Cores**: Multiple processing units in one CPU
- **Architecture**: 32-bit vs 64-bit processing

### Memory Amount
- **RAM capacity**: More RAM allows running more programs
- **Memory speed**: Faster RAM improves performance

### Storage Speed
- **SSD vs HDD**: SSDs provide much faster data access
- **Interface**: SATA, NVMe connections affect speed

### Graphics Processing
- **Integrated graphics**: Built into CPU
- **Dedicated GPU**: Separate graphics card for intensive tasks

## Types of Computers

### Personal Computers
- **Desktop**: Full-size, expandable systems
- **Laptop**: Portable with built-in display and battery
- **Tablet**: Touchscreen interface, ultra-portable
- **Smartphone**: Pocket-sized computer with cellular connectivity

### Servers
- **Purpose**: Serve data and applications to other computers
- **Features**: High reliability, powerful processors, lots of RAM
- **Form factors**: Rack-mounted, tower, blade servers

### Embedded Systems
- **Integration**: Built into other devices
- **Examples**: Smart TVs, cars, appliances, medical devices
- **Characteristics**: Specialized, efficient, reliable

## Practice Activities

### Activity 1: Identify Components
Look at a computer (desktop or laptop) and try to identify:
1. Where the CPU is located
2. How many RAM slots are visible
3. What storage devices are installed
4. What input and output devices are connected

### Activity 2: Performance Check
On a Windows computer:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Click on the "Performance" tab
3. Observe CPU, Memory, and Disk usage
4. Notice how usage changes when you open programs

### Activity 3: Binary Practice
Convert these decimal numbers to binary:
- 5 = ?
- 12 = ?
- 25 = ?

(Answers: 101, 1100, 11001)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Computer Running Slowly
- Check available RAM and storage space
- Look for programs using high CPU
- Ensure adequate cooling and ventilation
- Consider SSD upgrade if using HDD

### Computer Won't Start
- Verify power connections
- Check if power supply is working
- Listen for diagnostic beep codes
- Try removing and reseating RAM

### Strange Noises
- Clicking from HDD may indicate failure
- Loud fan noise might mean overheating
- Regular maintenance can prevent issues

## Summary

Computers are complex systems with many interconnected components working together. Understanding the basic hardware components—CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices—provides the foundation for more advanced IT concepts. The binary system underlies all computer operations, converting our human-readable data into the 0s and 1s that computers can process.

In our next lesson, we'll explore operating systems and how they manage these hardware components to create a user-friendly computing environment.
